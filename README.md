# Vector
This JavaScript web game allows players to interactively shoot balls using the mouse. The game's mechanics are grounded in trigonometric and physical principles, providing a realistic simulation of ball movement.

Key Features:

Ball Shooting Mechanism:  
 Players can click and drag to set the initial angle and power of the shot, using trigonometric calculations to determine the trajectory.  
Ball Movement:  
 The ball's motion is calculated using kinematic equations, considering initial velocity, angle, gravity, and air resistance.  
Adjustable Physics Parameters:  
 Players can adjust the gravitational force and friction, affecting how the ball travels and slows down.
